# MindFlow

## Summary

MindFlow is an innovative AI architecture inspired by a Buddhist theory of Mind--a psychological model of nine consciousnesses. This architecture is designed to emulate human-like processing by structuring an artificial agent into modular services, including sensation, cognition, emotion, memory, and wisdom. By integrating these components, MindFlow aims to achieve a balanced and holistic approach to artificial intelligence, enabling agents to not only perceive and conceive but also to reflect upon themselves and their experiences.

## Main Architecture

MindFlow's architecture is divided into several key modules, each responsible for a different aspect of the AI's processing capabilities:

- **Sensation Module**: Handles the perception of external stimuli, acting as the interface between the agent and its environment.
- **Cognition Module**: Processes the information gathered by the sensation module, enabling the agent to make sense of its surroundings.
- **Emotion Module**: Generates emotional responses based on the processed information, adding a layer of human-like reactivity and decision-making.
- **Memory Module**: Stores experiences and information, allowing the agent to learn from past actions and to adapt its behavior over time.
- **Wisdom Module**: Integrates the outputs from all other modules, facilitating self-reflection and the application of learned knowledge to new situations.

These modules work in concert to create an AI agent capable of complex behaviors and decision-making processes that mirror human psychological processes.
